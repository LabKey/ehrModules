kinship	Genetics	js	Kinship	true		ehr	kinshipSummary				false	false		qcstate/publicdata	This report shows the kinship coefficient between every animal in the colony. The kinship coefficient is a measure of relatedness between two individuals. It represents the probability that two genes, sampled at random from each individual are identical (e.g. the kinship coefficient between a parent and an offspring is 0.25).
inbreeding	Genetics	query	Inbreeding Coefficients	true		study	Inbreeding Coefficients				false	false		qcstate/publicdata	This report shows the inbreeding coefficient of each animal, where pedigree data is available. The inbreeding coefficient is the kinship coefficient between the individual's parents. It measures the probability that the two alleles of a gene are identical by descent in the same individual (autozygosity). It is zero if the individual is not inbred.
