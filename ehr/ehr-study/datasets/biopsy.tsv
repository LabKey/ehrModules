r86054	2009-07-08	09b026	lt73	Final Morphologic Diagnosis: Liver: no significant histologic lesions. The sections of liver examined have no significant histologic changes and must be considered normal. The small size of the samples must be considered in the face of hypoalbuminemia. Focal lesions or lesions deep within the parenchyma may be missed. Histopathologic Description: Liver (1, 2): Four needle biopsy sections of liver are examined. There is mild crush artifact. There are two small foci of lymphocytic inflammation (4-5 cells) adjacent to small bile ducts.
rhau72	2009-07-02	09b024	lt73	Final Morphologic Diagnosis:  1.  Placenta:  within normal limits.  Comment:  Areas of mineralization and of necrosis are not uncommon in interm or post mature placentas. Histopathologic Description:  There are 2 sections of tissue.  In one umbilical vessels are also present.  In one section there is an area of necrosis.  Scattered throughout both sections are some areas of mineralization.
r95022	2009-07-02	09b025	lt73	Final Morphologic Diagnosis: 1.  Subcutaneous tissue:  Lipoma. Comment:  This is a common and inconsequential lesion.

r97103	2009-06-12	09b023	lt73	Final Morphologic Diagnosis: 1.  Multifocal cholangiohepatitis, moderate, with mixed inflammatory cells.  Comment:  The specimen is quite small, and how representative it is of the entire liver is unknown. The significance of the basophilic stippling of hepatocellular cytoplasm is also unknown. Histopathologic Description: Present are 2 slides with multiple small fragments of hepatic tissue.  The largest fragment contains abundant collagenous connective tissue and large bile ducts.  Within the stroma are mixed inflammatory infiltrates with neutrophils and eosinophils, as well as lymphocytes and macrophages.  In the smaller fragments are multiple microfoci with neutrophils, lymphocytes, occasional necrotic hepatocytes, mostly around small ductules.  The cytoplasm of many hepatocytes in these fragments contains baslophilic stippling.
r02091	2009-06-03	09b022	lt73	Placenta: normal mature placenta. Mineralization is a normal finding in mature to pos-mature placental tissue of rhesus macaques. Histopathologic Description: Placenta (1): There is mild multifocal mineralization of placental stroma.
cj0906	2009-04-20	09b020	lt73	Progesterone or progesterone-like secretions from the ovarian tumor may have contributed to the development of the uterine tumor. Histopathologic Description: Slide 1:  Present are sections of each ovary and of the uterus. There are 2 sections of an enlarged ovary (12 x 8 mm).  Expanding and displacing normal ovarian structures is an unencapsulated, multilobulated cellular mass composed of large eosinophilic polygonal cells supported by a fine fibrovascular stroma.  Cell borders are distinct.  There is variable vesiculation of the eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Nuclei are round, large, often open, with 0 to 1 nucleoli, and sometimes with clumped chromatin. Mitotic figures are not observed. A section of the opposite ovary and fimbria is unremarkable with a solitary follicle present.A section of the 16 mm diameter uterus is also present.  Effacing most of the endometrium, extending through
r86058	2009-04-08	09b019	lt73	The primary neoplasm cannot be determined from the sections examined. The dermal changes noted clinically may be due to a paraneoplastic syndrome. These complexes of symptoms occur in approximately 10% of human cancer patients with malignant disease. Lung, mammary, gastric, and uterine cancers are most commonly associated with dermal paraneoplastic symptoms in humans. Histopathologic Description: Axillary lymph node (1): Lymph node parenchyma is almost completely effaced and replaced by a population of neoplastic cells that form sheets, ribbons, and acini filled with brightly eosinophilic material. Neoplastic cells are present on the serosal surface of the capsule. Cells are cuboidal to polygonal with small amounts of lightly basophilic cytoplasm and indistinct margins. Nuclei are round to oval with finely stippled chromatin and 1 to 2 prominent nucleoli. Mitoses range from 2-8/hpf

The superficial dermis has moderate diffuse lymphoplasmacytic inflammation with small numbers of eosinophils. Some follicles had small numbers of lymphocytes infiltrating into the basal cell layer.
rh2073	2009-03-25	09b016	lt73	Liver:  hepatic amyloidosis, diffuse, severe. Comment:  It should be noted that the diffuse, severe is in a very small specimen.  However, in conjunction with the clinical assesment of an hepatomegaly, the biopsy may be representative of a significant portion of the liver.Histopathologic Description: Present are 4 serial sections of fragments of liver from a needle biopsy.  The fragments are all similar.  Hepatocytes are separated by abundant homogenous eosinophilic material.  Some residual sinusoids are present.  Neither portal or central lobular architecture is present in these small sections.  An SSAB (alcian blue) stained section confirms that the eosinophilic material described above is amyloid.
r88082	2009-03-06	09b015	lt73	Mammary:  Lipoma.  Comment:  This is a benign lesion. Histopathologic Description: Present are 3 sections of the mass submitted.  All are similar.  The tissue consists of well-differentiated adipocytes supported by a fine fibro-vascular stroma.

Comment:  There is no evidence of an epithelial inclusion cyst (suggested in previous biopsy).  The etiology of this lesion is unknown. Histopathologic Description:  There is an intense eosinophilic infiltrate throughout the superficial and mid-dermal areas of these sections.  In addition some eosinophils are present around small blood vessels extending down into the underlying adipose tissue.  Lymphocytes are also present in increased numbers in the superficial and mid-dermal areas, including occasional lymphoid nodules.  In the mid-dermis are foci of black pigment-laden macrophages (pigmentary incontinence).  Dense superficial keratotic layers and prominent rete pegs are consistent with normal ischial callosity anatomy.
