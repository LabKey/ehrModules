r01056	2009-12-15	00300901	1970-01-01 14:39:00	Review of complete history by behavior management and veterinary staff.  History of frequent, often severe wounding events in this singly housed male.  In September 2004, animal was first noted to have minor wounds from fighting with partner.  Multiple minor wounding events over the next year ultimately resulted in the separation of this pair in August 2005.  Multiple attempts were made to pair this animal with other conspecifics and were unsuccesful due to aggression by this male.  Animal has been singly housed since 8-31-2005.  First self-wounding event may have been as early as 7-11-2007 but event was poorly documented.  Another event reported in January 2008 and then in April 2008.  Frequent self-wounding events began in July 2008.  Initially wounding events occurred at 2-4 week intervals; frequency began increasing dramatically in October 2008.  Targets include primarily the upper arms but also occasionally the legs.  Animal received BCG vaccinations in July 2008.  Distribution and timing of SIB is inconsistent with vaccine reaction.  Wounding events do not seem to correlate with cage washing, sedations, or changes in care staff on that floor.  In October, animal began receiving additional foraging opportunities.  Increased frequency of wounding noted in November after moving to room a260, where animal is currently housed.	Escalating self-wounding events may be related to housing location.  Staff reports observed antagonism between this animal and two other specific animals in that room (cy0165 and r01022).   Wounds have been quite severe; concerned about possible escalation of injurious behavior.	Relocate this animal to a quiet room without any overly-dominant males.  Place in cage away from door to minimize disruptions to this animal.  Monitor closely for changes in attitude or presence of new wounds.  If wounding events continue, need to consider alternative intervention.  Pharmacologic intervention will be warranted if relocation does not alleviate wounding.  Animal will continue to receive additional foraging opportunities from behavior management staff.  cc/js	so: Review of complete history by behavior management and veterinary staff.
